	abstract = {Regulatory T cells (Treg) are crucial in the proper balance of the immune system. A better characterization of Treg-specific genes should extend our knowledge on their complex biology. However, to date there is no consensual Treg signature in the literature. Here, we extracted a molecular Treg meta-signature relative to CD4+ conventional T cell from 8 different but comparable publicly available microarray datasets. We confirmed the validity of our result using the much larger but less stringent Immuno-Navigator database. However, many genes of the Treg meta-signature were also expressed at the protein level by other immune cell subsets, as assessed by mass cytometry, with the noticeable exceptions of Il2ra, Ctla4, and Tnfrsf9. Surprisingly, the proenkephalin (Penk) gene was a prominent member of this restricted Treg meta-signature. Further analysis of public datasets and of our own RNA sequencing experiments confirms that Penk was over expressed by Treg in various murine tissues, including thymic Treg. Interestingly, Penk expression was increased in intra tumoral Treg whereas it was down modulated in the central nervous system of mice suffering from EAE. Finally, we propose a mechanistic model linking TNFR signaling and the transcription factor Batf in the regulation of Penk expression in Treg. Altogether, our results provide the first Treg meta-signature in mice and identifies Penk as a novel and unexpected Treg marker.TregRegulatory T cellsTconvConventional T cellsTNFRSFTumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Super FamilyTMSTreg Meta-SignatureTFTranscription FactorsPenkpro-enkephalinMENKMet-EnkephalinPPIProtein-Protein InteractionsFDRFalse Discovery RateEAEExperimental Autoimmune Encephalitis},

abstract={A critical component in the interpretation of systems-level studies is the inference of enriched biological pathways and protein complexes contained within OMICs datasets. Successful analysis requires the integration of a broad set of current biological databases and the application of a robust analytical pipeline to produce readily interpretable results. Metascape is a web-based portal designed to provide a comprehensive gene list annotation and analysis resource for experimental biologists. In terms of design features, Metascape combines functional enrichment, interactome analysis, gene annotation, and membership search to leverage over 40 independent knowledgebases within one integrated portal. Additionally, it facilitates comparative analyses of datasets across multiple independent and orthogonal experiments. Metascape provides a significantly simplified user experience through a one-click Express Analysis interface to generate interpretable outputs. Taken together, Metascape is an effective and efficient tool for experimental biologists to comprehensively analyze and interpret OMICs-based studies in the big data era.},

abstract = {Summary
Non-lymphoid tissues (NLTs) harbor a pool of adaptive immune cells with largely unexplored phenotype and development. We used single-cell RNA-seq to characterize 35,000 CD4+ regulatory (Treg) and memory (Tmem) T cells in mouse skin and colon, their respective draining lymph nodes (LNs) and spleen. In these tissues, we identified Treg cell subpopulations with distinct degrees of NLT phenotype. Subpopulation pseudotime ordering and gene kinetics were consistent in recruitment to skin and colon, yet the initial NLT-priming in LNs and the final stages of NLT functional adaptation reflected tissue-specific differences. Predicted kinetics were recapitulated using an in vivo melanoma-induction model, validating key regulators and receptors. Finally, we profiled human blood and NLT Treg and Tmem cells, and identified cross-mammalian conserved tissue signatures. In summary, we describe the relationship between Treg cell heterogeneity and recruitment to NLTs through the combined use of computational prediction and in vivo validation.}
